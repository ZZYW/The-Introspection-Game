The Introspection Game
====================

background
--------------------

Being very interested in exploring the way people form their self-recognition, self-knowledge, self-identifying, we started our series of work "the rest of me" from 2013. As new media artists, we employed new technologies, such like virtual reality, bio sensing, depth 3d printing, to create experience that helps us to question our assumptions, understand the way we think and why we think that way.


After [FLOW](http://zhenzhenqi.info/flow/) and [Sukhavati](http://yangwang.info/sukhavati/), Zhenzhen and I started our new project "The Introspection Game" based on all of the feedback and experience we have learnt. We are pushing the experience to a more immersive, narrative, game like direction.


what is this project specifically about?
--------------------

The Introspection Game creates the whold fictional universe by your own body. 
The game starts from a scene that completely resembles the reality room where you are in, then gradually transferring into the fictional world. Each object in the universe is actually a manifestation of one of your bio-data. We want to create this world that is fictional, non-real, yet so real and so deeply connected to yourself. As the player gradually realizes the connection between the strange world and him/herself, he/she would have this so sublime yet so intimate experience.
