The Introspection Game
====================

background
--------------------

Being very interested in exploring self-recognition, self-knowledge, self-identifying, we started our series of work from 2013. As new media artists, we employed the new technologies, such like virtual reality, bio sensing, depth 3d printing, to create projects that helps us to understand ourselves, understand the way we think and why we think that way.


After [FLOW](http://zhenzhenqi.info/flow/) and [Sukhavati](http://yangwang.info/sukhavati/), Zhenzhen and I started our new project "The Introspection Game". Based on the two we have done, we are pushing the experience to a more immersive, narrative direction. 




what is this project specially about
--------------------

The Introspection Game creates this fictional universe by your own body. The game starts from a scene that completely resemble the reality scene you are in, then gradually transferring into the fictional world. Each object in the universe is actually a manifestation of one of your bio-data. We want to create this world that is fictional, non-real, yet so real and so deeply connected to yourself. As the player gradually realize the connection between the strange world and him/herself, he/she would have this so sublime yet so intimate experience.
